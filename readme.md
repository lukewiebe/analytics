# Home-Grown Analytics

I want analytics for my blog, but I don't like Google and everything else is way overkill for me. The solution: roll my own!

The backend is a basic Flask server that records incoming POST requests to a csv file. The frontend is a tiny piece of JavaScript that I'm embedding on each page of my blog.

That's the whole thing!
