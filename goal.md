# Goal of this Project

This is going to be the backend of a dead simple homemade analytics system for my blog.

The server will run probably on DigitalOcean, and it'll count incoming POST requests and record the information sent along with them. To keep the project simple, I'll stick to CSV for data storage.

The front end of the analytics will be a JavaScript snippet that I append to every page on my blog. Since I've never used JavaScript before, I'll have to learn how to make this. It should send along all the information I'll want, like which page it's coming from and maybe some simple information about the user.
